# About
  Minimalist nolibc integration of [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3):
    * Input is read ONLY from STDIN
    * The generated hash is wrote directly to STDOUT
    * C99 source compiled without libc

  The reference source code has been barely modified. In files where changes were required, the original code has been kept for future reference / study.

# Authors
  The authors of the reference implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3#intellectual-property).

  This 'nolibc implementation' was written by Fabio Panettieri.
